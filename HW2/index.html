                    When choosing classical outfit, you can always take some neutrol tones which can easily be combined with white grey and black.
                    As you can see from the first image on the right, these are some comfortable colors which can look good in every situation.
                    Moreover, there are plenty of such colors that always can be combined with each other, so there is a huge choice.

                    Nonetheless, sometimes we need some variety in the outfit, so we will need to spice it up a little bit.
                    You can always start with adding some bright and eye-catching color and making an accent on it with your already existing neutral colors.
                    This is clearly and creatively illustrated on the second and third images, violet hoodie with grey outfit looks very natural.
                    However it is important to point out the cold tones of grey, which give the outfit fir for violet color. 
                    On the third image we can see that red patterns are also existent on the hoodie and footwear, which makes it easier to combine with red jacket.

                <p>
                    You can always choose to mess up with bright and defiant colors in your outfit, but what I wanted to say is that neutral colors look really clean and are easy to set up together.
                    Bright colors, when combined together with creativeness and smartness give artistic and gorgeous effect. You can see on the 4th image that this bright emerald and pinky colors looks clean on black and white basis.
                    Combining colors is actually an art for me.
